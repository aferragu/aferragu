Hi, I’m @aferragu, Assistant Professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay.

I am an applied mathematician and researcher, with emphasis on mathematical analysis of network. I
like to simulate things in Julia, because it's clean and super fast

Check out my [personal site](https://aferragu.github.io) for more info.
